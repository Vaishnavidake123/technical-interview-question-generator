# Technical Interview Question Generator

This is a simple web page that allows users to generate technical interview questions based on the selected role and experience level. It provides a static HTML interface with JavaScript logic to display predefined questions.

## Features

* **Role Selection:** Choose from "Web Developer," "Data Scientist," and "Cybersecurity Analyst."
* **Experience Level Selection:** Select from "Entry-Level," "Junior-Level," "Mid-Level," "Senior-Level," and "Lead-Level."
* **Predefined Questions:** Displays a list of relevant technical interview questions based on the chosen role and experience level.
* **Simple and Static:** Built using HTML and JavaScript, requiring no backend server.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Use the dropdown menus to select the **Target Role** and **Experience Level** for the interview questions you want to generate.
3.  Click the **"Generate Questions"** button.
4.  The generated interview questions will be displayed below the button.

## Note

This is a static HTML interface. The actual generation of dynamic questions using Language Model (LLM) APIs (like Gemini or others) would require backend logic and API integration. This version provides a client-side implementation using predefined question sets.
